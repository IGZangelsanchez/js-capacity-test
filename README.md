# Javascript Capacity Test

Application designed to prove a javascript developer capacities. This application is part of the [Iris](http://thegameofcode.github.io/iris/) [examples](http://thegameofcode.github.io/iris/examples/todo-list/index.html). We have added new functionality to be implemented.

## Instructions

- Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
- Clone this repository in your local
- Install NodeJS dependencies: `npm install`
- Launch the server: `node app.js`
- Access in your web browser (Google Chrome recommended) to `http://localhost:3000`
- Try to complete all unfinished parts
- Send the solved project to `rrhh@intelygenz.com`

## Unfinished parts

There are three files with unfinished parts:

`public/app/todo.js`
 - lin. 59: If the todo text contains the word "important", add the class "important". (1 point)

`public/app/welcome.js`
 - lin. 22: Filter by text. (2 point)
 - lin. 28: Show only todos with text "important". The URL should change like filter does in `self.awake` function. (4 point)

`public/app/resource.js`
 - lin. 119: Important counter (3 point)

## Notes

 - Only your code is important, the design won't be valued.
 - Comments and maintainability of the code will be appreciated.

Thank you very much,
