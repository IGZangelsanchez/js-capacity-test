# Javascript Capacity Test

Application designed to prove a javascript developer capacities. We are using an application that is part of the [Iris](http://thegameofcode.github.io/iris/) [examples](http://thegameofcode.github.io/iris/examples/todo-list/index.html) and we have added new functionality to be implemented.

## Instructions

- Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/). (Note: Windows requires a restart to detect the new PATH or you can run the files from the installation folder)
- Clone this repository in your local
- Install NodeJS dependencies: `npm install`
- Launch the server: `node app.js`
- Access in your web browser (Google Chrome recommended) to `http://localhost:3000`
- Try to complete all unfinished parts (you can modify any file, write new functions, create new files, etc...)
- Send the solved project to `rrhh@intelygenz.com`

## Unfinished parts

There are three new funcionalities to develop:

`public/app/todo.js`
 - lin. 59: If the item text contains the word "important", add the class "important". __(1 point)__

`public/app/welcome.js`
 - lin. 20: Filter items by text typed in the search text input. __(5 points)__

`public/app/resource.js`
 - lin. 119: Important counter. This counter shows the current number of important todos. __(4 points)__

## Notes

 - Only your code is important, the design won't be valued.
 - Comments and maintainability of the code will be appreciated.
 - A modern web browser is required. The latest version of Chrome, Safari and Firefox. IE9 and greater should work, IE8 does not.

Thank you very much,
